🦽🧑‍🦼Eye-tracker for individuals with limited mobility who can only move their eyes, with low cost webcam.

👋I'm a Korea university student developing a webcam-based eye-tracking algorithm!

🏪 Currently, I volunteer at a senior Alzheimer's disease care center every weekday.
I've met many patients with Parkinson's disease there who have significant mobility issues and, unlike other dementia patients, struggle with speech.
I noticed that one of the few body parts they can move freely is their eyes, which sparked the idea of using eye movements for communication.

😢💵However, most eye-tracking devices on the market rely on expensive infrared sensors, often costing upwards of $500.
This makes them unaffordable and inaccessible for many of the low-income seniors I work with.

🧐That’s why I’m focused on building a low-cost eye-tracking solution using only a standard home webcam.
I hope that this technology would be available to those who need it most.
